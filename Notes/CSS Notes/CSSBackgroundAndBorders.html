	<p>The background of elements can be changed by assigning the "background" attribute.</p>
	<p id="colorbackground">This background can be set to be a color, or an image. For instance the body of this is set to an non-repeating image, while this line is a color.</p>
	<p id="borders">You can also add borders to any element. You need three attributes to make a border work: width, color, and style. You can either set these individually using border-width, border-color, or border-style attributes, or you can do shorthand like so: "border: width  style color;". There are many other, more intermediate attibutes to be used here, especially ones useful to modern design, but for now these are the basics.</p>
